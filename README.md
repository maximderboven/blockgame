# JAVA BLOCKGAME
KDG BLOCKGAME - Maxim Derboven & Alexie Chaerle 2020-2021
Our java block game can be compared to tetris. Only the blocks don't fall down. But you can't rotate them and put them anywhere.

## Installation

Java 11.0.9  
Java-swt (JavaFX)


## Usage
Simple as it is, run class MAIN  
Use vm options: 

```
--module-path "C:\Program Files\Java\javafx-sdk-11.0.2\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.graphics,javafx.media
```

## Contributing
I no longer edit this JavaFX project.  
Later I want to make this as a phone application.
